     "title": "Perfect Sabudana Khichdi Recipe",
     "edit":false,
     "description": "If there’s one dish that is quintessential during the fasting or vrat season in the Indian subcontinent, it has to be Sabudana Khichdi. Made with sago pearls or sabudana, boiled potatoes, roasted peanuts and a few spices, Sabudana Khichdi Recipe is most popular during the fasting days of Hindu festivals like Navratri, Mahashivratri and Ekadashi. Many people have many ways of making it. However, here, I have shared many to-dos for the most perfect, non-sticky Maharashtrian style khichdi made with sabudana. This is the recipe I have been making for decades.",
     "ingredients": "1. sabudana\r\n2. tapioca\r\n3 . water",
     "recepieSteps": "Soak Sabudana\r\n1. Rinse 1 cup sabudana, sago or tapioca pearls a couple of times in running water until all the starch is washed away. You can use a colander while rinsing.\r\n\r\nSoak sabudana in water. The water level can be 1 to 1.5 inches above the sabudana.\r\n\r\nIn the picture below, sabudana pearls are already soaked. Depending on the quality of sabudana, you can soak them overnight or for some hours.\r\n\r\nI always soak them overnight, since even after soaking them for 2 to 3 hours, they don’t soften.\r\n\r\n2. To check if sabudana has become soft or not, you should be able to easily press the sabudana and it should get mashed easily.\r\n\r\nIf there is some hardness in the center of the sago pearls, then add a few tablespoons of water in the bowl. Cover and leave for 30 minutes more.\r\n3. Using a strainer or colander, strain all the water from sabudana. Strain very well as there should be no extra water in the sabudana. Keep aside.\r\n\r\nRemember to drain the water really very well. Any water logged in the sago pearls will make your khichdi mushy or pasty.",

     "description": "Dosa also called as Dosai (in Tamil language) is a famous and popular South Indian breakfast or snack in India as well in the rest of the world. Dosa are basically crispy or soft crepes made with ground and fermented lentil and rice batter.\r\nTo make the batter, first the lentils and rice are soaked in water for 4 to 5 hours. They are then ground separately to a fine consistency.\r\n\r\nThen both the lentil batter and the rice batter are mixed with salt in a wide bowl or pan. This batter is then allowed to ferment overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.\r\n\r\nAfter the batter is fermented, it increases in volume, has a pleasant fermented aroma and a slightly sour taste. A well-fermented batter makes the best dosa. You will also see many tiny air-pockets in the batter.\r\n\r\nMaking the batter and then fermenting it is such a joy that I always look forward to making fermented foods like dosa and Idli.\r\n\r\nThe fermented batter is poured on a seasoned cast-iron pan or skillet (tawa) and spread like a pancake and cooked till crispy and golden with a drizzle of oil or ghee.",

The wrong combination of fruits can create discomfort in the stomach or even affect your body’s ability to absorb the nutrients.\r\n\r\nTo be on the safer side, I have chosen sweet fruits like mango, banana, chikoo (sapota), pomegranate, figs, strawberries and papaya for my fruit salad.

     "recepieSteps": "1. First, slice a loaf of garlic bread or baguette or French bread into 1-inch thick slices. Here I have used whole wheat garlic bread.\r\n2. Heat a griddle, tawa, or large skillet over medium heat. Add the slices of bread. Instead of toasting bread on a skillet, you could opt to toast bread in the oven or a toaster.\r\nIf toasting in the oven, toast for 5 to 7 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius/356 degrees Fahrenheit in a preheated oven until crispy and golden. Half way through the baking, turn over the slices if needed.\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, prepare the avocado filling. Rinse the avocado under cold water and pat dry. Then use a sharp knife to cut the avocado in half width-wise, going all the way around the pit. Gently twist the two halves apart.\r\n\r\nTIP: Always use ripe avocados. Gently press the skin; if it feels firm then the avocado is not yet ripe.\r\n\r\nA ripe avocado should feel a bit soft when you gently press the skin. I usually buy unripe ones and wrap them with a loosely woven cotton napkin, and allow them to ripen on the counter for a day or as needed.",

     "description": "Oatmeal Porridge is a delicious breakfast staple that is easy and quick to prepare. And it is fantastic to customize! Make it with water or milk or a combination of both and with either quick cooking oats or rolled oats (old fashioned oats). Here I share my favorite no fail Oats Porridge recipe.",
     "ingredients": "1. Sugar \r\n2. Water\r\n3. quick-cooking oats ",
     "recepieSteps": "1. First, add ½ cup quick-cooking oats or rolled oats in a pan.\r\n\r\nNote: When buying oats or oats products for babies, be sure to check the contents label on the pack. It should only list oats and no other flavorings or additional ingredients.\r\n\r\n2. Add 1 cup of water.\r\n\r\n3. Then add ½ cup milk or as needed. You can also add more water for a dairy-free recipe.\r\n\r\nConsistency can be easily adjusted as per your requirements. ½ cup milk gives a slightly thick consistency. For a thinner consistency, you can add more milk or water.\r\n\r\nNote that the water or milk can be added less or more depending on the type and brand of oats. So do also read the instructions on the packet.\r\n\r\n4. Add sugar as per taste. I just added 2 tablespoons raw sugar or white sugar. Sugar is completely optional. If adding fruits later, then you can skip sugar.\r\n\r\nIf adding honey, then add when the porridge becomes lukewarm or cools down at room temperature, as honey when heated becomes toxic.",
